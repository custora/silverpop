Silverpop Ruby Client
=========

Ruby client for IBM Marketing Cloud's Silverpop Engage and Transact API. The initial version
of this gem was extracted from ShoeDazzle.com in 2010 by George Truong. This code is under MIT license.

This branch has updated/added methods to work with the Engage API in 2016. Updates
have been made for Custora's specific needs. As such, some methods have not been
tested and may no longer work. Ensure the client is in sync with current Silverpop
documentation before relying on its method calls.

Requires Nokogiri, net/http, net/ftp, and uri.
